As a result, such private key(s) are necessary in order to control, sell and\n          otherwise dispose of the BANANA tokens stored in such digital wallet or vault. The loss of the private key(s)\n          needed to access such digital wallet or vault containing a purchaser’s BANANA tokens will result in such\n          purchaser’s effective loss of such BANANA tokens. Furthermore, any third-party that gains access to such\n          private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a digital wallet or vault service that a\n          purchaser uses, may be able to misappropriate a purchaser’s BANANA tokens. Any errors or malfunctions with\n          respect to the digital wallet or vault a purchaser uses to receive and store BANANA tokens, including such\n          purchaser’s failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, could also result in such\n          purchaser’s effective loss of BANANA tokens. Additionally, a purchaser’s failure to precisely follow the\n          procedures for buying and receiving BANANA tokens, including, for instance, providing the wrong wallet or\n          vault address for receiving BANANA tokens, could result in such purchaser’s effective loss of BANANA tokens.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>\n          Risks Associated with the BNB Chain Protocol (BNB) or other Blockchain Protocol that runs Banana Token.\n        </Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          BANANA tokens are based on the BNB Chain. As such, any malfunction, unintended function, unexpected\n          functioning, forking, breakdown or abandonment in the BNB Chain protocol or other Blockchain protocol, or any\n          attack on such, could cause BANANA tokens to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner,\n          including, but not limited to, impacting your ability to transfer or securely hold BANANA tokens. Such impact\n          could adversely affect the value of BANANA tokens. Furthermore, advances in cryptography or other technical\n          advances, such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to BANANA tokens by rendering\n          ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the BNB Chain protocol or other blockchain\n          protocol.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          Hackers and other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the functioning and\n          ownership of BANANA tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, undertaking malware attacks,\n          denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because\n          BANANA tokens are based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third-party or a member of the ApeSwap\n          Foundation team could intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into BANANA tokens which could in\n          turn be exploited by such groups. It may be difficult for the ApeSwap Foundation to maintain or develop BANANA\n          tokens to address emerging issues or malicious programs that develop adequately or in a timely manner, and\n          ApeSwap Foundation may not have adequate resources to do so. Such events could result in a loss of trust in\n          the security and operation of BANANA tokens, which could materially adversely affect the value of BANANA\n          tokens and the ownership thereof.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risk of Theft of Funds Raised in the Token Generation Event</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          The ApeSwap Foundation will make every effort to ensure that the funds received from the BANANA token sale\n          will be securely held. Notwithstanding such security measures, there is no assurance that there will be no\n          theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of\n          service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the ApeSwap Foundation website, in the smart contract(s) on\n          which the escrow wallet and the BANANA token sale relies, on BNB Chain or any other blockchain, or otherwise.\n          <br />\n          Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse\n          thereof. In such event, even if the BANANA token sale is completed, the ApeSwap Foundation may not be able to\n          receive the cryptocurrencies raised. In such case, the ApeSwap platform and any associated plans might be\n          temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed BANANA tokens may hold little worth or value.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Intervention in One or More Jurisdictions</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          Blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies are relatively recent technologies which have developed rapidly\n          and have been rolled out into numerous applications. This evolution has presented novel issues in terms of the\n          classification, regulation and control of these technologies. As a result, it is often unclear what, if any,\n          regulatory regime is applicable to blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies.\n          <br /> As the popularity of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, as well as the aggregate\n          capitalization of cryptocurrencies, have grown, blockchain technologies have come under the scrutiny of\n          various regulatory bodies around the world, and in some cases initiated efforts to regulate, their use and\n          operation.\n          <br /> In light of this evolving technological and legal landscape, the regulation of tokens (including BANANA\n          tokens), token offerings, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges is likely to\n          continue to evolve rapidly, to vary significantly among international jurisdictions and regulatory bodies, and\n          to be subject to significant uncertainty. Going forward, various legislative, executive, and regulatory bodies\n          in countries could adopt laws, regulations or guidance, or take other actions, which could materially\n          negatively impact the functioning, use or legality of BANANA tokens. For example, regulatory inquiries or\n          actions, including the imposition of licensing requirements or restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of\n          digital tokens such as BANANA tokens, could impede, limit or terminate the development of the tokens.\n          <br /> Furthermore, any failure by the ApeSwap Foundation, purchasers of BANANA tokens or related parties to\n          comply with any laws, rules, and regulations, some of which may not yet exist or may be subject to uncertain\n          or varying interpretation, and which may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse\n          consequences for such parties, including civil penalties and fines.\n          <br /> The regulatory landscape of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies is also uncertain and varied.\n          Various jurisdictions could, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect BANANA\n          tokens. Such laws, regulations or directives may negatively and impact ApeSwap Foundation business. The effect\n          of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the\n          ApeSwap Foundation, the value of the tokens and holders tokens.\n          <br /> New or changing laws and regulations, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could also\n          materially adversely affect the value of currencies into which BANANA tokens may be exchanged, the liquidity\n          of the tokens, the ability to access marketplaces or exchanges to trade the tokens and the structure, use and\n          transferability of the tokens. The ApeSwap Foundation may choose to cease operations in a particular\n          jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate\n          in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to operate in\n          such jurisdiction.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risks Inherent in the Interoperable Nature of Cryptographic Tokens</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          Cryptographic tokens, especially those built on the BNB Chain, such as BANANA tokens, are generally tradable\n          on exchanges or through direct peer-to-peer trading protocols that are not currently regulated by any\n          governmental authority in a manner that traditional stock or equity interests are regulated. Therefore,\n          purchasers of BANANA tokens are not afforded any of the protections of laws or regulations that purchasers of\n          traditional shares or equity would enjoy. Additionally, the ApeSwap Foundation has included transfer\n          restrictions as a condition for the purchase of any BANANA tokens, but, due to the interoperability of BNB\n          Chain tokens, such as BANANA tokens, the ApeSwap Foundation may not be able to effectively enforce such\n          restrictions and may be unable to prevent the negative consequences of unauthorized BANANA token transfers and\n          potentially subject the ApeSwap Foundation to regulatory fines, actions or registration requirements.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risks Associated with Cryptocurrency Exchanges</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          Cryptocurrency exchanges on which BANANA tokens may trade may be relatively new and largely unregulated and\n          may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established regulated exchanges. To the extent that\n          the cryptocurrency exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in BANANA token trading are\n          involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such cryptocurrency exchange\n          failures may result in a reduction in the price and can adversely affect the value of the tokens. A lack of\n          stability in cryptocurrency exchanges and the closure or temporary shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges due to\n          fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may result in greater\n          volatility in the price of the tokens.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risks Related to Future Sales or Issuance of BANANA tokens</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          Any future sale or issuance of the BANANA tokens would increase the supply of BANANA tokens in the market and\n          this may result in a downward price pressure on the BANANA tokens. The sale or distribution of a significant\n          number of BANANA tokens outside of the token generation event (including but not limited to the sales of\n          BANANA tokens undertaken after the completion of the pre-sale and issuance of BANANA tokens to persons other\n          than purchasers for purposes outlined in the whitepaper), or the perception that such further sales or\n          issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of BANANA tokens.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risks Related to Token Taxation</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          The tax characterization of BANANA tokens in the United States and elsewhere is uncertain. Purchasers of the\n          tokens must seek their own tax advice in connection with purchasing, holding and selling the tokens, which may\n          result in adverse tax consequences, including withholding taxes, increased income tax liability and additional\n          tax reporting requirements. Purchasers of the tokens should consult with and must rely upon the advice of\n          their own professional tax advisors with respect to the U.S. and non-U.S. tax treatment of their receipt,\n          purchase, holding and sale of the tokens.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risk of Negative Publicity</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          Negative publicity involving the ApeSwap Foundation, BANANA tokens, or any of the key personnel of the ApeSwap\n          Foundation, regulation of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. or worldwide, may materially and adversely affect the\n          market perception or market price of the BANANA token, whether or not it is justified.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risk of Personal Information Disclosure</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          The ApeSwap Foundation may determine, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to obtain certain\n          information about a purchaser of BANANA tokens in order to comply with applicable law or regulation in\n          connection with selling BANANA tokens to such purchaser. A purchaser may be asked to provide such information\n          upon request, and the ApeSwap Foundation may refuse to sell BANANA tokens to such purchaser until they provide\n          the requested information and the ApeSwap Foundation has determined that it is permissible to sell BANANA\n          tokens to them under applicable law or regulation. The ApeSwap Foundation will take reasonable measures to\n          ensure that any such disclosed personal information is maintained confidentially and/or destroyed as\n          applicable, but where such information is transmitted or stored electronically, there is a risk of its\n          unintentional disclosure to third parties as a result of hacking, accidental disclosure or disclosure demanded\n          by governmental authorities.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Risk of Uninsured Losses</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          Unlike bank accounts or accounts at certain other financial institutions, BANANA tokens are uninsured as a\n          store of value unless a purchaser specifically obtains private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of\n          loss or loss of value of BANANA tokens, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance\n          Corporation, or private insurance arranged by the ApeSwap Foundation, to offer recourse to a purchaser of\n          BANANA tokens.\n        </Text>\n        <Heading>Unanticipated Risks</Heading>\n        <Text as=\"p\" variant=\"sm\" sx={styles.text}>\n          Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks discussed here there are\n          risks that the ApeSwap Foundation cannot anticipate. Further risks may materialize as unanticipated\n          combinations or variations of the aforementioned risks, or yet unforeseen risks, develop. Such risks could\n          have unanticipated consequences, including a material adverse impact on the value of BANANA tokens or the\n          ownership thereof.\n        </Text>\n      </FlexContainer>\n    </Container>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default React.memo(TermsOfUse)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
